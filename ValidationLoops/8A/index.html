    <h2>What does this program look like if done with a while loop? With a for loop? Which is better?</h2>
    <p>I used a do/while loop to execute the code, so long as the userGuess does not match the password.</p>
    
    <h2>Did you use == or ===? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>I used the triple does not equal (!==), but the double does not equal (!=) also works.</p>
