    <h2>What is the data-type (e.g. string or integer) of the information that comes in? What happens if the user inputs a number -- does it stay an integer? Use typeof and console.log() to help with this.</h2>
    <p>The information that comes in is stored as a string.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if the user clicks "OK" (or equivalent) without typing anything in? What information gets assigned to a variable, if any?</h2>
    <p>The variable is assigned as an empty string.</p>
    
    <h2>How did you choose your variable names? If you gave a list of variable names to someone who hasn't seen your code, could they reasonably predict what information you might store in each?</h2>
    <p>Initially I had named my variables name, age, hometown and number. After checking my code with the solution, I changed the variable number to favNumber to make it more specific.</p>
    
    <h2>If you completely changed a question you were asking the user, would it make sense to totally rename the variable? What if you changed the order of your questions?</h2>
    <p>I think the variable should reflect the answer that the user will input in response to the prompt. If you are no longer asking the user for her name, it doesn't make sense to store her response as name.</p>
    
    <h2>In these exercises, we use prompt() to collect information, but most websites do that ask for information do not use prompt() -- how do they collect information (what HTML elements do they use)? What might be an advantage to doing it that way instead of with prompt()? Are there any disadvantages? Why might you use prompt()?</h2>
    <p>In HTML, the input and select tags prompt the user for information. This process is better for creating forms. JavaScript prompt is more commonly used for something like asking the user her name to give the site a more personalized feel.</p>
    
    <h2>Research prompt() -- is there any way to make it so that there are two (or more) fields?</h2>
    <p>I could not find anything to make this happen without the use of jQuery.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
