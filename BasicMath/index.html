    <h2>What happens when you try to parse the integer out of a string like "Error 404"? How about "404 Error"? Other combinations of numbers and letters? What needs to be true about the incoming string for it to be parsed correctly?</h2>
    <p>I think you could split the string of letters and numbers, loop through and if you can, convert to an integer (I used Number()), otherwise skip to the next possible.</p>
    
    <h2>What happens if one (or more) of the inputs are non-numeric text (like a comma or a dollar-sign)? What errors occur, if any? What does the console output tell you?</h2>
    <p>It returns NaN, which stands for not a number.</p>
    
    <h2>Why might you use the increment (++) or decrement (--) operators? What are some applications that you predict might come into play?</h2>
    <p>The increment and decrement operators may be useful for keeping score, tally, inventory or total. </p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
