    <h1>6A</h1>
    <h2>What do you call true and false values?</h2>
    <p>Booleans</p>
    
    <h2>How is true similar or dissimilar from "true"? Can they be used in the same way?</h2>
    <p>Without quotes true is a boolean value and with quotes "true" is a string.</p>
    
    <h1>6B</h1>
    <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
    <p>The password is case sensitive.</p>
    
    <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
    <p>I used ===. It seems to be the only operator that works. If I used = or == it accepted anything as a matching password, even if I entered nothing and just hit 'okay'.</p>
    
    <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
    <p>If the password is stored in plain text anyone can search through the source to easily find it.</p>
    
    <h1>6C</h1>
    <h2>If you collect the user's input as a string (i.e. without using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), does == work to compare the input to the stored secret number? Would === work? Which is best?</h2>
    <p>When collected as a string, the only time the userNumber matched the secretNumber was with the ==. The secretNumber is stored as a number and the double equal (==) is the only operator that allows us to compare unlike types.</p>
    
    <h2>If you collect the user's input as an integer (i.e. by using parseInt() to turn it into an integer), can you use == to compare? ===? Which is better in this case?
What is the difference between == and ===?</h2>
    <p>Both worked in the cases of entering the number correctly, not entering the number correctly and not entering a number at all. Because the secretNumber does not have quotes around it, it is stored as a number. The triple equal (===) works because it comparing the same type and the double equal (==) works because it does not require the two values to be of the same type.</p>
    
    <h2>In this case, does it make more sense to leave the user's guess as a string, or to convert it to an integer? Why? What are the relative advantages / disadvantages of each approach (particularly in terms of the types of new features that might be able to be added)?</h2>
    <p>I think it makes more sense to leave the user's guess as a string in case it is a combination of both letters and numbers.</p>
    
    <h1>6D</h1>
    <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
    <p>No, because it checks to see each one applies.</p>
    
    <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
    <p>I used && to check if the age was between 0 and 15. I don't think either is necessarily a better choice.</p>
    
    <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
    <p>I used Number() rather that parsInt(), and everything entered that is not an integer comes back as NaN.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
    <p></p>
    
    <h1>6F</h1>
    <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
    <p>It does not matter what order I put the conditional statements in because I have a range for each statement. Each answer can only fit into one.</p>
    
    <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
    <p>Those conditionals are mutually exclusive.</p>
    
    <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>The variables would have to be assigned before, so it might be easier to have a different version for a different country. Or the program could prompt the user for the legal ages before asking for her own.</p>
