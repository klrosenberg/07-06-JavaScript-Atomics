    <h2>Does it matter if the user-provided password matches your password exactly, or is there some flexibility allowed in capitalization?</h2>
    <p>The password is case sensitive.</p>
    
    <h2>Did you use = or == or === to compare passwords (or something else)? Why? Would any of the others work?</h2>
    <p>I used ===. It seems to be the only operator that works. If I used = or == it accepted anything as a matching password, even if I entered nothing and just hit 'okay'.</p>
    
    <h2>Why is it a bad idea to store a password (or other sensitive information) in plain text in a Javascript file?</h2>
    <p>If the password is stored in plain text anyone can search through the source to easily find it.</p>
