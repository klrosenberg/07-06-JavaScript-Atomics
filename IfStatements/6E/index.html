    <h2>Does it matter what order your if / else if statements happen? If you reorder them, does your program still produce correct output?</h2>
    <p>It does not matter what order I put the conditional statements in because I have a range for each statement. Each answer can only fit into one.</p>
    
    <h2>What's wrong with this conditional: if (age < 16 && age > 21)?</h2>
    <p>Those conditionals are mutually exclusive.</p>
    
    <h2>Let's say that your program needs to be easy to modify so that it works in parts of the country/world where the age ranges are different. How would you replace the numbers in your if statements with variables to make the program make sense? Or is it easier to just have the numbers be there? Does it matter?</h2>
    <p>The variables would have to be assigned before, so it might be easier to have a different version for a different country. Or the program could prompt the user for the legal ages before asking for her own.</p>
