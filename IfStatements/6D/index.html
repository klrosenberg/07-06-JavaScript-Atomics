    <h2>Does it matter what order your if-statements are in?</h2>
    <p>No, because it checks to see each one applies.</p>
    
    <h2>When testing ranges, did you use &&, ||, or something else entirely (e.g. nested if-statements)? If you used &&, why is that a better choice than || (and vice-versa)?</h2>
    <p>I used && to check if the age was between 0 and 15. I don't think either is necessarily a better choice.</p>
    
    <h2>What types of input produce a value of NaN after parsing? Is it important to check for NaN values? Is it possible for a NaN value to trigger any of the other if-statements? If so, how and why?</h2>
    <p>I used Number() rather that parsInt(), and everything entered that is not an integer comes back as NaN.</p>
    
    <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
