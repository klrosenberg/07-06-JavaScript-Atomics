  <!-- Answer the 5 questions above here -->
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what are some reasons to use variables?</h2>
  <p>Variables can be used for storing user responses.</p>
  
  <h2>What are some advantages to variable names like hairColor instead of hc (for example)? What are some disadvantages?</h2>
  <p>Specific variable names are clear and intentional but, because they are case sensative, may be mistyped easily.</p>
  
  <h2>Given what you know so far, what can you predict about other ways we might use variables?</h2>
  <p>Checking validity of user responses.</p>

  <h2>Why don't you need to use the var keyword every time you use a variable (right now, we only use it when we create the variable)? What does var do?</h2>
  <p>The keyword var affects the variable scope. Within a function, all undeclared variables are global. Only those with the var keyword are local.</p>
  
  <h2>What happens if you try to do output with a variable without first assigning a value to that variable? What happens? Does the program still work as intended? Do error messages show up in the console? If so, what error message?</h2>
  <p>When I deleted the value from the age variable, none of the alerts popped up even though I had declared a value for name and listed it first.</p>
  
  <h2>What questions do you have?</h2>
